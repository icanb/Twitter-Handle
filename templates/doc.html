	<h2>Disclosure</h2>

	<section class="hoverable">1. Purpose.  The parties hereto wish to explore business opportunities of mutual interest involving Health Pathways, Inc., Global Technology Resources and TechNexxus, LLC, including but not limited to a  a series of Healthcare Product Tracking and Distribution project business relationships and other healthcare system integration projects. In connection with these opportunities, each party may disclose to the other certain confidential, technical and/or business information, which it desires the receiving party to treat as confidential.</span>

	<section class="hoverable">2. "Confidential Information" means any information of a proprietary and/or confidential nature disclosed by either party to the other party, either directly or indirectly, in writing, orally, electronically or by inspection of tangible objects (including without limitation documents, prototypes, samples, plant and equipment).  Confidential Information of a disclosing party may also include information of third parties that it discloses. Confidential Information shall not, however, include any information which, as shown by competent proof, (i) was publicly known and made generally available in the public domain prior to the time of disclosure by the disclosing party; (ii) becomes publicly known and made generally available after disclosure by the disclosing party to the receiving party through no action or inaction of the receiving party; (iii) is already in the possession of the receiving party at the time of disclosure by the disclosing party as shown by the receiving party's written records existing immediately prior to the time of disclosure; (iv) is obtained by the receiving party from a third party that may lawfully disclose such information without breach of any obligation of confidentiality; or (v) is independently developed by the receiving party without use of or reference to the disclosing party's Confidential Information, as shown by the receiving party’s independent contemporaneous written records. </span>

	<section class="hoverable">3. Non-use and Non-disclosure. Each party agrees not to use any Confidential Information of the other party or any third party for any purpose except to evaluate and engage in discussions concerning a potential business relationship between the Parties.  Each party agrees not to disclose any Confidential Information of the other party to third parties or to such party's employees, except to those employees of the receiving party who are required to have the information in order to evaluate or engage in discussions concerning the contemplated business relationship.  Neither party shall reverse engineer, disassemble or decompile any prototypes, software or other tangible objects which embody the other party's Confidential Information and which are provided to the party hereunder.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, a receiving party may disclose any Confidential Information to the persons or entities and to the extent required by applicable law, provided that the receiving party gives the disclosing party prompt written notice of such requirement prior to such disclosure and reasonable assistance in obtaining any available exemptions or limitations on the required disclosure.</span>

	<section class="hoverable">4. Maintenance of Confidentiality.  Each party shall protect and maintain the secrecy of the Confidential Information of the other party using measures at least as protective as those it takes to protect its own most highly confidential information, but in any event using at least commercially reasonable measures. Neither party shall make any copies of the Confidential Information of the other party unless the same are previously approved in writing by the other party, and any such copies shall reproduce the other party's, or any third party’s proprietary rights notices on any such approved copies, in the same manner in which such notices were set forth in or on the original.  The foregoing prohibition on copying shall not apply to archival backup copies of electronic information made in the ordinary course of business and prudent information and communications technology administration; provided, that such archival backup copies shall be protected as Confidential Information in accordance with this agreement.</span>

	<section class="hoverable">5. No Obligation.  Nothing herein shall obligate either party to proceed with any transaction between them, and each party reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate the discussions contemplated by this Agreement concerning the business opportunity.</span>

	<section class="hoverable">6. No Warranty.  All Confidential Information is provided “as is”.  Each party makes no warranties, express, implied or otherwise, regarding its accuracy, completeness or performance, including without limitation any warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of third party rights.</span>

	<section class="hoverable">7. Return of Materials.  All documents and other tangible objects containing or representing Confidential Information which have been disclosed by either party to the other party, and all copies and summaries thereof and derivative works derived therefrom which are in the possession of the other party, shall be and remain the property of the disclosing party and shall be promptly returned to the disclosing party upon the disclosing party's written request with the exception of one copy that may be retained by the receiving party to confirm compliance with the non-use and non-disclosure provisions of this Agreement. </span>

	<section class="hoverable">8. No License / Trademark.  Nothing in this Agreement is intended to grant any rights to either party under any patent, mask work right or copyright of the other party, nor shall this Agreement grant any party any rights in or to the Confidential Information of the other party except as expressly set forth herein. Further, except as agreed to in advance in writing, no right, express or implied, is granted to a party by this Agreement to use in any manner any name, trade name, trademark or service mark of the other party.</span>
